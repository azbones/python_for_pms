    "Git is a distributed software version control system. Git allows multiple developers or data scientists to work on the same application at the same time. The system allows all collaborators to see what changes have been made and provides a way to manage merging multiple versions of code together. Github is hosted version of Git that allows developers to have a central repository where code can be \"pushed\" to. Github is also the standard platform for open source data science software. If you want to get the sourcecode or contriute to an open source project, Github is often where you would start. Here are some examples of major open source data science projects in Github:\n",

    "Docker is a way to package applications into a \"container\" that contains all the code and settings for a given application to function. Containers are similar to virtual machines in that they isolate applications inside the container, but are lighter weight given they don't have to virtualize the entire operating system. In data science, container technologies like Docker are useful given that many data science environments are complex and require many different packages. The complexity of such environments is especially high when using more advanced machine learning and neural network libraries. \n",
